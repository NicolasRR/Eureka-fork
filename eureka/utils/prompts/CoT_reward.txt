The Python environment is {task_obs_code_string}. The task is : {task_description}. Given the task description and the proposed reward function, analyze the likely range of the input variables and the resulting reward values. Ensure that the reward is dense and exhibits a smooth, gradual increase rather than sparse or step-like increments. Consider the starting conditions of the environment carefully to design a reward function that promotes efficient learning and progressively enhances stability. Adjust the reward function as necessary to meet these objectives. The proposed reward function is {rewad_code}
